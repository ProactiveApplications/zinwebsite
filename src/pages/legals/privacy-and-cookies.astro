                        <p>This Privacy & Cookies Policy explains how <b>Zin Content</b> ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our website ("Website"). It also explains how we use cookies.</p>

<h3>1. Our tech stack (where data may be processed)</h3>

<p>Our Website uses:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Front-end application:</b> .NET Core v8.</li>
    <li><b>Domain, DNS and SSL/TLS:</b> <b>Cloudflare</b> (DNS and HTTPS/SSL certificate management).</li>
    <li><b>Analytics:</b> <b>Cloudflare Web Analytics</b> (privacy-focused website usage statistics).</li>
    <li><b>Contact form:</b> <b>Microsoft Forms</b> (embedded at the bottom of the page).</li>
    <li><b>Backend data storage and APIs:</b> <b>Xano</b> (for registered application users only).</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Personal data we collect</h3>

<h3>2.1 Data you submit via Microsoft Forms (contact form)</h3>
<p>If you use the contact form, you voluntarily provide personal data such as your name, email address, and the content of your message (and anything else you choose to include). This information is collected and processed via <b>Microsoft Forms / Microsoft 365</b>.</p>

<h3>2.2 Data collected automatically (technical data)</h3>
<p>When you browse the Website, limited technical data may be processed to deliver the service securely and reliably (for example, IP address, device/browser details, pages requested, timestamps, and referral information). This may be processed by our infrastructure providers (e.g., Cloudflare) for security and performance purposes.</p>

<h3>2.3 Analytics data (Cloudflare Web Analytics)</h3>
<p>We use Cloudflare Web Analytics to understand overall Website usage (e.g., page views, referrers, and performance trends). Cloudflare Web Analytics does <b>not</b> use cookies or localStorage to collect usage metrics and does <b>not</b> fingerprint individuals.</p>

<h3>2.4 Registered application users</h3>
<p>If you register for a ZinApp account, we store the data you create within the application (such as your Zins, tags, and account details) using <b>Xano</b> as our backend data provider. This data is transmitted securely over HTTPS and encrypted at rest by Xano's infrastructure on Google Cloud.</p>

<h3>3. How we use information</h3>

<p>We use information to:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Respond to enquiries</b> submitted through the Microsoft Forms contact form.</li>
    <li><b>Operate, secure, and maintain</b> the Website (including abuse prevention and troubleshooting).</li>
    <li><b>Understand aggregated usage</b> and improve Website performance and content (via Cloudflare Web Analytics).</li>
    <li><b>Provide the ZinApp application</b> to registered users (storing and retrieving user-created content).</li>
</ul>

<p>We do <b>not</b> sell personal data and do <b>not</b> use your data for third-party advertising.</p>

<h3>4. Legal basis for processing (UK GDPR)</h3>

<p>Where UK GDPR applies, we rely on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Legitimate interests</b>: running a secure, reliable Website and understanding aggregated usage trends.</li>
    <li><b>Consent</b>: where any non-essential cookies are used.</li>
    <li><b>Pre-contract steps / contract</b>: where you contact us about services (to respond to your request).</li>
    <li><b>Legal obligation</b>: where required.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Cookies</h3>

<p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device by your web browser. We use <b>essential cookies only</b>. These are strictly necessary for the Website and application to function. We do not use any cookies for tracking, advertising, or analytics.</p>
