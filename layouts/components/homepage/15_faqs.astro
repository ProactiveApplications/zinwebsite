    Can't I just use Apple Notes / Notion / Evernote?
  </summary>
  You could, but general-purpose tools don't provide the structure to produce content consistently. Zin is purpose-built for one specific job: capturing thoughts and turning them into content.

    Won't AI just do all this for me?
  </summary>
  No. AI can't invent your client stories, your real-life experience, or your insights. Those are unique to you and they are your strategic advantage.
ZinApp captures those inputs so that when you use AI, the output stops being generic and starts sounding like you.

  <summary>
    Is this yet another system I will give-up on?
  </summary>
  It's a fair question. ZinApp is designed to be minimal: capture fast, automatically tag your content and make it available when you need it. It's simple to use, but grows in its usefulness over time. 
  ZinApp works because it requires no maintenance, just seconds to capture and minutes to organise.

  <summary>
    Do I have time for this?
  </summary>
  
  That is why ZinApp works. 
  
  ZinApp captures your ideas when you have them, e.g. moments after a client call, during a commute, when you're out walking. It takes a less than a minute to capture a thought with ZinApp. 
  When you do sit down to write some content, you are not starting from a blank sheet. You are working from material you have already captured. It saves you time when it matters most: during content creation.

  <summary>
    What if I'm not a good writer?
  </summary>
You don't need to be. You just need to be willing to open your mobile and enter your thoughts as they come to you. You can easily tidy them later.
When it's time to create content, you'll have your authentic material to work with. That's what makes the writing easier: You are working with real ideas and thought, rather than having to think-up content out of thin air.
</details>


<details>
  <summary>
    Do I need to tag everything immediately?
  </summary>
No. Capture first, organise later. If you're in a rush, just save the Zin. You can add tags when you have more time. The priority is to capture the thought before it disappears.
